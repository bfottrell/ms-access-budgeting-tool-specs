## 3. Installation

1. Open a terminal or Git Bash window.  
2. Clone the repo to your local machine:  

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUser/ms-access-budgeting-tool.git
   ```  

3. Navigate into the project folder:

## 4. Implementation Steps

1. Back up any existing Access projects before importing.  
2. Double-click `BudgetTool.accdb` to open in Access.  
3. If prompted, click **Enable Content** to allow VBA macros and ActiveX controls.  
4. In the VBA editor (press Alt+F11), go to **Tools → References** and confirm the following libraries are checked:  
   - Microsoft Office 16.0 Object Library  
   - Microsoft DAO 3.6 Object Library (or later)  
5. On the **Main** navigation form, click **Initialize** to create required tables and load sample departments.  
6. Open **Options → Admin Settings** to configure email reminders, PDF export paths, and user roles.  

---

## 5. Usage

- Enter or edit budgets under **Budget Entry → [Your Department]**.  
- Managers use **Bulk Upload** to import CSVs of line-item data.
